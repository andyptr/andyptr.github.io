## 1) Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow (OPF) for Radial Distribution Grid

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Notebook-orange)](./another-page.html)

In this project, I developed a multi-objective opf algorithm by adapting a second-order conic programming (SOCP) convex relaxation. The developed algorithm can also be used to solve a conventional load-flow problem. 

The proposed algorithm shows a signficant computational speed improvement compared to commercial solver and higher accuracy compared to the conventional OPF techniques i.e., linear/DC load flow.

|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
