### Hi ðŸ‘‹

  
  
This page contains some insight of my current research projects as a power system researcher. The projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. You can access them by clicking on ![iPython](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-orange?logo=Jupyter)
  


## 1) Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow (OPF) for Radial Distribution Grid

This project focuses on operational planning for distribution grid / microgrid with high peneteration of distributed energy resources, such as PV system. In particular, I developed a controller that formulated as multi-objective optimal power flow (OPF) (optimization problem) with **convex relaxation**. The main objective of the proposed controller is to compute the optimal techno-economic operation of the grid, which then can be utilized by distribution system operator (DSO) or microgrid operator.


Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is also presented, which show how selection of controller parameters can impact the operating region of the controller. In terms of performance, the proposed controller shows having a very-high accuracy compared to traditional OPF techniques such as linear/DC OPF.
