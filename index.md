## 1) Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow (OPF) for Radial Distribution Grid

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-orange?logo=Jupyter)](Projects/01_OPF_Multi_Objective.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I developed a multi-objective opf algorithm by adapting a second-order conic programming (SOCP) convex relaxation. The developed algorithm can also be used to solve a conventional load-flow problem. 

The proposed algorithm shows a signficant computational speed improvement compared to commercial solver and higher accuracy compared to the conventional OPF techniques i.e., linear/DC load flow.</div>
